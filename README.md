# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sahil Prajapati

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Science student at Galgotias University, graduating in 2026. I'm passionate about developing impactful full-stack web applications that are not only responsive and scalable but also user-centric. With a strong command over modern JavaScript frameworks and backend technologies, I focus on solving real-world problems through clean and efficient code.

My experience ranges from building entertainment platforms and developer tools to productivity and AI-powered applications. I thrive in environments that encourage learning, creativity, and collaboration. Currently, I’m actively looking for SDE or Software Engineering internship opportunities starting in 2026.
